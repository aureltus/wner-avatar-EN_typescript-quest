## Level 1

- Which are the different primitive data types in TypeScript?
- How to type an Array?
- What is the `any` type?
- How to type the return of a function as well as the type of its parameters?

## Boss level

You've learned a lot of things! Now it's time to put it into practice through this exercise in pairs!

### Part 1 : Heroes

Create a `Hero` class that allows you to create objects with the following properties:

```ts
name: string;
power: number;
life: number;
```

And the methods

```ts
  attack(opponent: Hero)
  isAlive()
```

The `attack` method has an `opponent` parameter (of type `Hero`). It is necessary to reduce the number (`life`) of `opponent` by as much damage (`power`) of the attacker.

â€‹*Example: If the Joan instance, attacks the Leon instance, it will be represented by this method call:*

```ts
joan.attack(leon);
```

The `isAlive` method should return `true` if the hero's life points are greater than zero and `false` otherwise.

Create two instances of `Hero` and check that the `attack` and `isAlive` methods work.

**Constraint to add**: you now have to make sure that the `name`, `power`, `life` properties are private. You will have to create methods to access their value and modify their value.

### Part 2 : Weapons

â€‹
Create a `Weapon` class with the following property:

```ts
name: string;
```

Add the `weapon` attribute (of type `Weapon`) to the `Hero` class without modifying the constructor (so `weapon` is not initialized).

Create three classes `HeroAxe`, `HeroSword` and `HeroSpear` that inherit from `Hero`.

These three classes call the constructor of their parent and initialize `weapon` with instances of the `Weapon` class whose names will be `axe`, `sword` or `spear` as the case may be.

In the `HeroAxe`, `HeroSword` and `HeroSpear` classes, redefine the `attack` method to take into account the following cases:

- `HeroAxe` : if the type of `opponent` is `HeroSword`, multiply `power` by two
- `HeroSword` : if the type of `opponent` is `HeroSpear`, multiply `power` by two
- `HeroSpear` : if the type of `opponent` is `HeroAxe`, multiply `power` by two

Tip: use the `super` keyword to call the `attack` method of the parent class.
â€‹
Create instances of the three classes `HeroAxe`, `HeroSword` and `HeroSpear` and check that their `attack` methods work correctly.
â€‹

### Part 3 : Battle

Create a loop that makes two instances of subclasses `Hero` fight each other (they attack at the same time).

When at least one of them is dead, display `{heroName} wins`. If both are dead, display `It's a draw`.

---

**_Bonus 1 : Weapon damage_**

_Add a `damage` property to the `Weapon` class and make sure it is initialized by the constructor._

_Edit the `attack` method of `Hero` so that the damage is calculated as follows: the hero's power `power` + the weapon's damage `power`_

**_Bonus 2 : User interface_**

_Create a user interface for the application (for example, with a choice of heroes and weapons, and a visual on the damage inflicted)_
